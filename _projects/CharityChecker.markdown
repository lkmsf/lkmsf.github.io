Charity Checker is a Chrome browser extension that automatically pulls concise, relevant information about a charity when you are on their website or secure donate page. It lets you see what percentage of your dollar actually goes to support the cause, and also gives you more detailed information about the charity's financial accountability, potential concerns, credibility ratings, and more. We also have developed an Alexa application that gives you information about a charity that you ask about verbally, and remembers which charities you previously donated to!

This was for the 2019 Stanford Treehacks Hackathon. It was my first hackathon and my first experience creating a large coding project from scratch. It was fun to just jump into project - and of course great practice using google search.

I am senior studying Mathematical and Computational Science and coterming in Computer Science at Stanford University. I have always been interested in STEM growing up but my love for engineering and especially programming was really sparked when I joined my high school FIRST robotics team. At Stanford, I thoroughly enjoy section leading CS106b (Programming Abstractions) and volunteering with other tech education organizations on campus. I'm interested in anything and everything in the intersection of technology and education.

Outside of school, I love rock climbing - particularly indoor bouldering. I'm an avid fantasy reader, and more recently enjoy sci-fi as well :). Some of my favorites books include Robin Hobb's *Realm of the Elderlings*, Patrick Rothfuss's *Name of the Wind*, and Orson Scott Card's *Ender's Game* series. I played piano for 9 years, clarinet for 6. I'm currently picking up guitar, albeit still a bit painfully. I also find joy in cooking, petting my three cats, and sharing puns. If you've made it this far: I wasn't sure how to start writing my python function, then I thought def descriptive_function_name().

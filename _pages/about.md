I am senior studying Mathematical and Computational Science and coterming in Computer Science at Stanford University. I have always been interested in STEM growing up but my love for engineering and especially programming was really sparked when I joined my high school FIRST robotics team. At Stanford, I thoroughly enjoy section leading CS106b (Programming Abstractions) and volunteering with other tech education organizations on campus.
